    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      I’m proud to announce the creation of my own charity, The Spark Foundation.
Our mission is to give children the opportunity to live stable, comfortable, and fulfilling lives.
We’re beginning our work right here in Marquette, focusing on supporting local families in need. As the foundation grows—something I truly hope and pray for—I plan to expand our reach to help even more children and families beyond our community.
I want to make it clear that I will not keep a single dollar of the funds raised. Every contribution will go directly toward helping children, and I’ll be posting receipts to maintain full transparency.
If you’d like to support this cause, you can help by sharing our message or making a donation. Every contribution, no matter how small—even a single dollar—can make a meaningful difference in a child’s life.

      We keep <strong>absolutely zero money</strong> from donations — every dollar goes directly to helping children in need.
